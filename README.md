# Poker Game Revisit

Author: SÃ©bastien Roy
Status: In Progress

## Background

This project is a rewrite and revisit of one the first projects I completed when I first started programming. The initial goal of the project was to create an algorithm that could detect if a poker player's hand of cards has a flush. While I I accomplished its initial goal, it expanded into something a little bigger, and I spent coutless hours building a full 2 player poker game in Visual Basic. It had a full user interface, game play with player actions, and even sound effects! It was very enjoyable to build something for the first time, and that project helped me think about exploring the possibility of starting a career in software development.

The goal of this project is to revisit the old code base, rewrite it in another language (or two), and make improvements to it as I go.
